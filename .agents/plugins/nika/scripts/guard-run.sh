# guard-run — the execution seatbelt, THIN: the judgement now lives IN
# the binary (`nika guard`). This shim only carries the host's payload
# to it and its verdict back — the regex/split era is over (P0-15 ·
# audit UX 2026-07-30: 21 documented bypasses, from the absolute-path
# miss to the unquoted split that failed open on an empty file token).
#
# ONE script, TWO dialects, sniffed from stdin (`hook_event_name` is
# Claude Code's, absent from Cursor's; Codex emits the Claude Code
# dialect verbatim — live-proven 2026-07-12):
#   Cursor  (docs/agent/hooks · beforeShellExecution): in {command, cwd}
#   Claude Code (hooks.md · PreToolUse · matcher Bash): in
#     {hook_event_name, tool_name, tool_input:{command}, cwd}

# Loi 12 — the hooks are a seatbelt, never the airbag: a missing or
# broken judge must be VISIBLE. The fallback below emits a
# guard_unavailable DENIAL naming the degradation, never the silent
# fail-open that made the old hook claim the check had passed.

  # SCOPE FIRST. A degradation is only ours to report about a command
  # that could have been ours. Without this, a missing binary denied
  # EVERY shell command in the session — `ls` came back « nika run
  # blocked » — and the README's own macOS bullet says a GUI-launched
  # Cursor not inheriting PATH is a normal Tuesday. Fail-visible must
  # not mean fail-on-everything (2026-08-02).
  #
  # The filter is EXACT, not a heuristic, and it is not the regex era
  # returning: the judge itself only ever claims a command whose word is
  # `nika` or `nika-cli` (guard.rs, the dispatch), and both contain this
  # substring. A payload without it would come back NotOurs from the
  # binary too — so staying silent here loses nothing the guard ever had.
